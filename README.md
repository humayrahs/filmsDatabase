Import films.csv and display using Proccessing(Java)
This project takes input from a .csv, converts into a Film class with relevant headings,and displays them in a line graph format. The size of the plot, x and y axis, and colour indicate different features of the film.

Time scope: 5th November 2021 - 8th December 2021

Limitations:
•	The getters weren’t used as I coded all my functions in the class, I could re-evaluate what functions need to be in the class as behaviours and what needs to be in the main file as accessing class information
•	I did not consider the scale of my program when setting the goals, this led to me having to rush some of the features in the end because it took a long time for me to get the basic functions working (for reference, I have made 12 iterations in 3 weeks but most of the iterations were working out importing table data and making the scales)
•	Problems are obvious with the presentation – no measures have been taken to combat overlapping, the higher parts of the scale (nearing 60) have no data despite it existing in the csv suggesting error with mapping
•	Code tidiness needs to be done
•	Some repetitive code could be simplified
•	The worst part was definitely with the column sorting algorithm and me forgetting the map function meaning I spent 4 hours trying to figure out a scale for the x and y axis
•	I didn’t get to add in the legend I wanted properly
